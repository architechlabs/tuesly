"""Common device interface protocol for BLE mesh devices.

Defines a Protocol class that all device implementations (MeshDevice,
SIGMeshDevice, BLEConnection, SIGMeshBridgeDevice, TelinkBridgeDevice)
conform to. This allows duck-typing across different transport mechanisms
while maintaining type safety with mypy and pyright.

 Extracted from device.py, sig_mesh_device.py, connection.py,
and sig_mesh_bridge.py to eliminate code duplication and provide a
single source of truth for the common device interface.

    This protocol defines the minimal interface that all device classes

    SIG Mesh, or bridge HTTP).

    All implementations must provide:
    - address: BLE MAC address (uppercase, e.g. "DC:23:4D:21:43:A5")
    - is_connected: Connection state check
    - firmware_version: Firmware version string or None
    - connect(): Async connection with timeout and retry
    - disconnect(): Async disconnection and cleanup

    Implementations:
    - MeshDevice (device.py): Telink direct BLE
    - SIGMeshDevice (sig_mesh_device.py): SIG Mesh GATT Proxy
    - BLEConnection (connection.py): Low-level BLE transport
    - SIGMeshBridgeDevice (sig_mesh_bridge.py): SIG Mesh via HTTP bridge
    - TelinkBridgeDevice (sig_mesh_bridge.py): Telink via HTTP bridge
